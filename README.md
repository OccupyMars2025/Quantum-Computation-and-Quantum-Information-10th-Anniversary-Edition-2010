# How to design a quantum computer ? Recommend some textbooks
Designing a quantum computer involves understanding quantum mechanics, quantum information theory, and practical aspects of implementing quantum algorithms. Here are some recommended textbooks that cover various aspects of quantum computing and can help you get started:

1. **"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" by Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang**
   - This is a comprehensive textbook that covers both theoretical and practical aspects of quantum computing. It's widely used in academia and provides a solid foundation in quantum mechanics, quantum computation, and quantum information theory.

2. **"Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction" by Eleanor G. Rieffel and Wolfgang H. Polak**
   - This book provides a gentle introduction to quantum computing, suitable for beginners. It covers the basics of quantum mechanics, quantum circuits, quantum algorithms, and the potential applications of quantum computing.

3. **"Quantum Computing Since Democritus" by Scott Aaronson**
   - This is a more philosophical and thought-provoking book by a prominent quantum computing researcher. It covers the history, philosophy, and fundamentals of quantum computing, making it an interesting read alongside more technical textbooks.

4. **"Programming Quantum Computers: Essential Algorithms and Code Samples" by Eric R. Johnston, Nic Harrigan, and Mercedes Gimeno-Segovia**
   - This book focuses on practical aspects of programming and implementing algorithms on quantum computers. It provides hands-on examples and code samples using various quantum programming languages.

5. **"Quantum Computing: An Applied Approach" by Jack D. Hidary**
   - This book emphasizes the applied aspects of quantum computing, including quantum algorithms and their implementations. It's suitable for readers who are interested in understanding how quantum computing can be practically applied in various fields.

6. **"Quantum Computing: From Linear Algebra to Physical Realizations" by Mikio Nakahara and Tetsuo Ohmi**
   - This textbook bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and physical implementations of quantum computing. It covers quantum gates, algorithms, and provides insights into how quantum computing can be realized using different physical systems.

These textbooks should provide you with a solid foundation in quantum computing theory, algorithms, programming, and practical implementations. Depending on your background and interests, some books may be more suitable than others, but starting with Nielsen and Chuang's "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" is often recommended due to its comprehensive coverage.
